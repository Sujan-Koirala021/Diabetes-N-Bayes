# Diabetes prediction using Naive-Bayes

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period, which can lead to various complications affecting multiple organ systems. Early detection and prediction of diabetes play a crucial role in managing the condition effectively and preventing complications.

Machine learning techniques, such as the Naive Bayes classifier, have been widely used in healthcare for predictive analytics, including disease prediction. Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among predictors.

This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction model using the Naive Bayes classifier. By analyzing a dataset containing relevant patient attributes and their diabetes status, the model will learn patterns and relationships within the data to make predictions about the likelihood of an individual having diabetes.

## Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. 
The “Naive” part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Naïve Bayes classifier. The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label. The “Bayes” part of the name refers to Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian who formulated Bayes’ theorem.
